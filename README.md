vuejs-contenteditable
=====================

contenteditable binding for vuejs

Todo
----

v-model directive can only be used on textarea o or input elements for now.
It would be nice to use it on 'contenteditable' !

Content editable involves a lot more complexity than input bindings, 
and it's best to use an external library dedicated to this purpose (e.g. Medium.js), wrapped by a custom directive.
